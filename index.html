            I don't just build websites, I build websites that SELLS
    
        </h3>
        <p>
            I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
    
            I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I uploaded on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using.

            <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>I first got involved with code when I was a teenager. I remember very clearly walking home from school in eighth grade. I was about 17 and I heard my teacher say, “Check what I made!!!.” And I was like, “Wait, you can have one of those?” I used to believe only businesses or companies could have websites. I was spellbound. I went home that day and started looking up how to make websites, I grasped very basics of HTML and CSS from W3school. Later I learned I could customize my site more if I knew JavaScript. And I just kind of went from there. I tried different forums, where a lot of people got their start. I was very self-taught. I majored in computer science and and I wish to work as Software Engineer and help my clients.</p>
